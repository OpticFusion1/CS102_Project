# CS102_Project
A desktop game called ESCAPE made as a project for my freshman year programming class. It involved Java code which used inheritance, polymorphism, user interfaces, media libraries, abstract data types, various algorithms and game physics. I provided the src files and external image, music and text files that it links to!
