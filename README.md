# CS102_Project
The project I made for my freshman year Java course. It is a desktop game called ESCAPE, 
I provided the src files and external image, music and text files that it links to! 
The code for the project involves inheritance, polimorphism, use of abstract data structures,
some simple algorithms and some game physics.
